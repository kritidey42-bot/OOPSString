# OOPSString
This repository contains the implementation of Use Case 3 (UC3) of the OOPS Banner Application project.  UC3 enhances the previous implementation (UC2) by refactoring the banner rendering logic to use the String.join() method instead of the traditional + operator for string concatenation.
